            <h2>General Cannabis information</h2>
            <p>
                Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana, is a versatile plant that has been used for various purposes throughout history. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and comprises three primary species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. The plant contains a diverse range of chemical compounds, including cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids, which contribute to its unique properties. While cannabis has a long history of recreational and medicinal use, it has gained increasing attention in recent years for its therapeutic potential. The two most well-known cannabinoids found in cannabis are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), known for its psychoactive effects, and CBD (cannabidiol), recognized for its potential medicinal benefits. Cannabis can be consumed in various forms, such as smoking, vaporizing, edibles, and extracts, and its legal status varies widely across different regions and countries.

            <h2>THC vs CBD</h2>
            <div id="col_area">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol):</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Psychoactive Effects: THC is the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, responsible for the "high" or euphoric sensation that users experience.</li>
                        <li>Binding to CB1 Receptors: THC binds primarily to the CB1 receptors in the central nervous system, producing its psychoactive effects.</li>
                        <li>Effects on Cognition: THC can affect cognitive functions such as memory, concentration, and coordination.</li>
                        <li>Medical Uses: THC has therapeutic properties and is used medically for pain relief, nausea reduction (especially in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy), and stimulation of appetite (commonly in HIV/AIDS patients).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>CBD (Cannabidiol):</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-Psychoactive: Unlike THC, CBD does not produce a psychoactive "high." It does not bind strongly to CB1 receptors, which are mainly concentrated in the brain.</li>
                        <li>Interaction with CB2 Receptors: CBD interacts with CB2 receptors found in the peripheral nervous system and immune cells, contributing to its potential anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects.</li>
                        <li>Anxiolytic and Antipsychotic Properties: CBD is known for its potential anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) and antipsychotic properties, making it appealing for those seeking therapeutic benefits without the intoxicating effects.</li>
                        <li>Medical Uses: CBD has been explored for various medical purposes, including the treatment of epilepsy (Epidiolex, a CBD-based medication, is approved for certain seizure disorders), anxiety, inflammation, and pain management.</li>
