            <h2>The Ultimate Sport</h2>
            <p> 
                Power Slap as funny as it may seem is a extremely fun sport to watch and spectate; although it started more as a joke our hosehold has been sucked in by Power Slap. Power Slap as one can most likely gather from the name, is a sport where two 
                individuals complete in a slight fight. There are many rules to keep things fair and in check but the general rule is you have a match typically 3 or 5 round match where players take turns smacking each other. You can win by etheir knocking out your
                opponent or if both players are still standing it goes to scoring of the judges. It is super simple yet brtual which is why I like it, a handful of very simple rules, easy to digest scoring system, and then all you gotta do is watch two people smack each other.
                Power Slap has really taken off and is held by Dana White and sanctioned by the ufc with tons of sponors and high production videos, pay per view events, social media, brands sponors, and so so much more. It's easy to sit done with friends and watch the matches 
                betting on will win and how, seeing players get their backstory told proving lore to help build them as characters, rivals, and lots of trash talk. It might be dumb in some peoples eyes but they are provindg entertainment and getting paid to slap people so it sounds good to me.

            <h2>Is this real? Is this safe?</h2>
            <p>
                Power Slap is very real especially for the people competing they take it very seriously and put alot of time and effort into this. They had somewhat reality-tv type of show called Slap House where alot of the people fighting lived and trained together.
                They had full gyms, with personal trainers, and coaches that helped them build strength as well as learn technquie becasue it does not matter if you can slap people if you foul every single time you hit them. The more you train the better chance you have 
                but many also come out of nowhere with just as home training and still dominate some even pratice by letting their friends slap them! Although no contact sport is going to be safe they do take many steps to try and make it safer. The main part of fouls and rules
                is to keep every one and check and limit how cheapily they can get power. As well as medical staffer are their, catchers for when people pass out, and the ref can call a match if they think they need to for medical reasons.
