            <h2>Rules of Power Slap</h2>
            <p>
                Some might find it suprising but like an other sport Power Slap has its fair share of rules. This is needed to keep matches running smoothly as well as making sure the players are as safe as they can be. Like any other sport sometimes
                rules can seem more of a problem then solution as well as ref's do not always make the best calls or sometimes just do not call things in general. For the most part though power slap has worked out most of its issues despite being a new sport
                and things typpically go well. To make things easier il break this down into two different sections; rules and fouls.

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>Rules are what keep everything going smoothly in Power Slap without rules there would be chaos. The rules are simple but very important and one must be able to abide by these if they want to do well. Not following the rules means fouls which can result
                in not only losing points but even losing the match possibly. Many fighters have the power and endurance but do not excel because they can not follow rules. Here is a main run down of the rules.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 vs 1</li>
                <li>Coin toss for first hit</li>
                <li>60 seconds to recover and return a slap</li>
                <li>Weight classes and divisions</li>
                <li>Finishes(Points, KO, TKO, DQ)</li>
                <li>3-5 Rounds</li>
                <li>Scoring is based off of slap damage and effectiveness & defender reaction/ recovery </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fouls</h3>
            <p>Fouls are the biggest mistake a player can make in a Power Slap fight and can be pevitable in the match. One foul can cause you to lose the match in multiple ways. If one flinches then their opponent gets to go again meaning they got a free slap on you.
                Aswell as if you are striking someone and club or step then you will get deducted points and many times the matches come down to these points to declare a winner. Someone can knockout their opponent but if they fouled it's automatic disqualification and they lose
                on the spot. Below I will list the fouls.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flinching: Bodily movement that adversely affects a strike</li>
                <li>Illegal Wind-ip: A strike inconsistent with the wind-up Rule, at Section E(3), including number or hand announce.</li>
                <li>Clubbing: Any strike other than a permitted slap to the permitted target area</li>
                <li>Stepping: One or both of the Strikerâ€™s feet did not stay in contact with the ground through the completion of the strike</li>
                <li>Delay of Match</li>
                <li>Failure to follow referee instructions</li>
                <li>Use of abusive hate-based language </li>
            </ul>
