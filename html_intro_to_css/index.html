        <h2>Overwatch 2 a complicated relationship</h2>

        <h3>What is overwatch 2?</h3>
        <p>Overwatch 2 is a free-to-play, team-based action game set in the optimistic future, where every match is the ultimate 5v5 battlefield brawl. That is at least what its creator Blizzard calls it. It is a first-person shooter that consists of generally 5
            players on each team comprised of different characters called heroes. Each hero has a unique style, gameplay, mechanics, roles, abilities, lore, and are completely different to play. The teams are normally built of one tank, two damage, and two support heroes 
            although some characters can seem to overlap these classes. The game is played in a few different modes like escorting a payload, capturing points and holding them, or a sort of tug-of-war push with a robot that each team is trying to move. Although many play
            it casually including myself, even from a casual level the game is highly competitive and can be very hard to play. Every character's abilities are colorful and unique and fill up the screen, when things get hectic it can be hard especially from an outsider's
            view to even understand what is going on in the game.

        <h3>Why is Overwatch a complicated relationship?</h3>
        <p>I say it is a complicated relationship because although it is my favorite game right now and I've been putting in noticeable time between school and work into it, I find myself angry with the game and its creators constantly. The game has not got the love and care 
            it deserves. I admit it's very hard to upkeep a game especially when it comes to balancing gameplay and characters but Blizzard drops the ball a lot. The game is everchanging and you have to keep up with these changes if you want to keep doing well and understand 
            what is even going on. Constant nerfs or buffs to characters or complete reworks change the basic gameplay of a character which changes how all characters interact with them like who is weak against them, who counters them, who goes well with the team, and much more.
            Blizzard seem to shoot themselves in the foot a lot, and when they try to change something they end up making the opposite result of what they wanted. Blizzard seems to care more about releasing skins and battle pass content(the skins are amazing I won't lie) instead
            of trying to fix core gameplay issues or balancing issues. They promised PVE content for years and lied to their players about this and many things but never failed to release a new $20 battle pass every few months. Despite all this, the gameplay at its core 
            is addictive and fun, the characters are amazingly in-depth and different from how they play. Abbilities are unique for the most part and extremely creative, Blizard knows how to world and character build the creative direction is insane. The characters have extremely
            in-depth lore and info about them for a first-person shooter and Blizard has done many animated shorts on the characters that are visually beautiful and give insight into many things like the characters and overarching story. Even with all its flaws, I'm still excited 
            to boot it up whenever I can; even if it means il be raging later.
