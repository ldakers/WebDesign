        <h2>Reasons One Piece is alreadly my favorite anime</h2>
        
        <p>I am only currently 340ish episodes out of 1100ish episodes and One Piece has already become my favorite anime, and most likely favorite piece of media. I for the longest time did not want to start this anime because it
        was way too long and I thought most likely overrated. The more people told me to watch it, the less I wanted to go through the commitment of watching it all. Now that I have started I can not stop and have blown through roughly 100 episodes in the last month maybe even a little more than 100.
        Although the pacing can be slow at times overall the storytelling is amazing, everything feels very well-placed and balanced in the plot. Things are foreshadowed and then brought up later very well, Oda the creator has done a good job in 
        building his world and guiding the story through it. The characters are well-developed and many have deep lore without really needing to, it gives even side characters a lot of depth and makes the world seem very alive. The last arc I finished (Eneis Lobby) is some of 
        the best media I have seen, the dialogue is crafted well, the fights do well to develop each character and set a tone, every episode something insane is happening that has you on the edge of your seat. It sets some major tones for the rest of the anime and 
        shows what is to come in the future in just how involved in this world things can get. After a while, you do not doubt anything can happen in this world because of the countless unimaginable scenarios that the Strawhats are put in yet always pull through for each other.</p>

        <h2>Themes that One Piece is not afraid to tackle</h2>
        <p>Although One Piece is very funny and has some very unserious moments in it where Captain Luffy is especially dumb in his actions. The show often tackles very heavy/controversial topics that
            hit home and are things our world is faced with daily. Racism, corruption, slavery, classism, poverty, and many more subjects are explored throughout the show. In the show, Luffy the main character and captain of the crew does not see right or wrong
            in the way that their world powers would like. He thinks everyone should be free and deserves respect; he will go to war against a corrupt nation because they were mean to someone he likes or gave him food. The World Government is supposed to uphold justice
            and protect its people, yet we constantly see the opposite of this and it's the so-called bad guys like Luffy that are the ones who come in and save the citizens of these nations. Luffy is not afraid to tackle the whole leadership of the world if it means 
            doing what is right. The show is very much about opposing and dismantling these corrupt systems and not submitting to their ways of doing things. As long as you are good people Luffy will go to the end of the world to help them, regardless of what the world
            may say about that person.
